## Overall Verdict: Strong Pass for Module Engineering

Conceptual Difficulty: High (Greedy algo + custom sorting + clean modeling)
Core API: nonOverlappingMaximalIntervals(const std::vector<Interval>& input)
Output: Correct
Reusability: High
Encapsulation: Good
STL usage: idiomatic use of std::sort, std::vector, lambda

## Scoring Breakdown (Interview-style)
| Area                | Score | Comments                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Correctness         | 5/5   | Your greedy selection is correct. You sort by end time, take earliest finishing, and skip overlaps. Perfect.|
| Code Organization   | 5/5   | You used a module class (IntervalScheduler), encapsulated logic, and kept clean separation.                 |
| OOP Modeling        | 3/5   | The Interval class is a struct in spirit â€” but totally fine. Could use struct since it's all public.        |
| API Design          | 5/5   | const std::vector<Interval>& is idiomatic. Making a copy internally = good.                                 |
| Efficiency	      | 5/5	  | Sorting is O(n log n), selection is O(n). Well done.                                                        |


Elegance / Readability	Output is well-formatted, operator overload was nice. Could go further with spacing, naming, comments.

## Final Grade: 8.5/10 (Great job!)
